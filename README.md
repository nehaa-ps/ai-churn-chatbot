# ðŸ“ž AI Chatbot for Telecom Churn Control

This AI-powered project helps telecom companies retain customers by identifying high-churn-risk users using a machine learning model, then proactively engaging them through SMS and a chatbot interface.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Churn Prediction using a Random Forest model
- Automated messaging with Twilio API
- Chatbot interface powered by Google Gemini AI
- Vector-based semantic search using Sentence Transformers + FAISS
- Frontend built with Tailwind CSS
- Integrated chat interface with real-time responses

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. The churn model analyzes customer data and flags high-risk users.
2. Twilio sends them a personalized message with a link to the chatbot.
3. The chatbot, hosted via Flask, receives the user's query.
4. Gemini AI generates context-aware responses based on PDF knowledge using FAISS vector similarity.
5. All interactions are logged and returned to the frontend.
